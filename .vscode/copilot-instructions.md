# Copilot Instructions

## Experimental; no backward compatibility is required.
## Develop with aggressive try-and-error on short-lived Git branches.
## Execute all commands via the `#shell_execute` tool.
## Prefer fail-fast behavior.
## Use assertions (design by contract) for early error detection.
## Do not implement fallbacks; fail explicitly instead.
